## **Abstract**
Spotify, being one of the world's largest music platforms, serves as the backdrop for this project. The goal is to understand the factors influencing song popularity, employing regression models for analysis. The project encompasses data preprocessing, visualization, and the application of regression algorithms such as Linear Regression, Random Forest, Ridge Regression, and Lasso Regression to forecast song streams.

## **Methodology**
The project follows a comprehensive methodology:

**Data Collection:** Utilizing a dataset from Kaggle.
**Data Preprocessing:** Handling inaccurate or null values to ensure data accuracy.
**Data Visualization:** Employing various plots to comprehend attribute relationships.
**Data Analysis:** Identifying influential factors, with a focus on attributes like Loudness and Energy.
**Regression Models**: Implementing Linear Regression, Random Forest, Ridge Regression, and Lasso Regression to predict song streams.

## **Results**
The research identifies Loudness and Energy as pivotal factors in predicting song popularity.There is a significant lack of variance in popularity values.
Data Set appears to be extremely screwed Therefore only a moderate accuracy can be found
